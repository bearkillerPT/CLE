# Large Scale Computation
## General Problems
There are 2 distinct problems to be solved. Firstly a single-threaded program in C then using the following libraries to introduce concurrency:
- pthread
- MPI
- CUDA

The first exercie is to count the amount of words, of words prefixed by a vowel and of word sufixed by a consonant! The examples used to test are:
1. text0.txt - 1000 words
1. text1.txt - 10000 words
1. text2.txt - 100000 words

The second exercise is to calculate a squared matrix determinant. The examples used to test are:

1. matrix0.txt - 5 x 5
1. matrix1.txt - 10 x 10
1. matrix2.txt - 30 x 30
